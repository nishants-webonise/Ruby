INSERT INTO `recipes` VALUES ('Classic Baked Acorn Squash','The weather has finally decided to cool down around here and the first acorn squash have appeared at our local farmers market. Acorn squash are wonderfully easy to prepare – just cut them in half, scoop out the seeds, add a little brown sugar and/or maple syrup, and bake for a little over an hour. From Google Definitions,\nChoose squash that are heavy for their size and have a hard, deep-colored rind free of blemishes or moldy spots. The hard skin of a winter squash protects the flesh and allows it to be stored longer than summer squash. It does not require refrigeration and can be kept in a cool, dark place for a month or more, depending on the variety. Once the seeds are removed, winter squash can be baked, steamed or simmered. They’re a good source of iron, riboflavin and vitamins A (more than summer squash) and C.\n','Classic Baked Acorn Squash Recipe','10 minutes','1 hour, 15 minutes','1 Acorn squash1 Tbsp Butter2 Tbsp Brown Sugar2 teaspoons Maple SyrupDash of Salt','1 Preheat oven to 400°F.\n2 Using a strong chef\'s knife, and perhaps a rubber mallet to help, cut the acorn squash in half, lengthwise, from stem to end. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and stringy stuff in the center of each half. Score the insides of each half several times with a sharp knife. Place each half in a baking pan, cut side up. Add about a 1/4 inch of water to the bottom of the baking pan so that the skins don\'t burn and the squash doesn\'t get dried out.\n3 Coat the inside of each half with 1/2 a Tbsp of butter. Add a dash of salt if you are using unsalted butter. Add a Tbsp of brown sugar to the cavity of each half. Dribble on a teaspoon of maple syrup to each half.\n4 Bake in the oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, until the squash is very soft and the tops are browned. Do not undercook. When finished, remove from oven and let cool a little before serving. Spoon any buttery sugar sauce that has not already been absorbed by the squash over the exposed areas.\n','Serves 2 to 4, depending on how much squash you li'),('Red Chile Marinated Grilled Chicken','This is some of the best chicken I’ve ever eaten – grilled, roasted, baked, whatever. Juicy, spicy, tender, lipsmackin’ good. Here’s the deal, there are two ways to make this recipe. One way entails making your own red chile sauce from scratch, using dried ancho and guajillo chiles that you can usually only find at a specialty Mexican market. Even our local Whole Foods doesn’t carry these dried chiles. The second method starts with a base of canned red chile sauce, which is a little easier to find in a regular supermarket, and saves quite a few steps. I’ve made this recipe both ways. As you might expect, if you have access to the dried chiles and can make the time to make your own sauce base, it’s totally worth it for the extra intensity and depth of flavor. The good news is that if you can’t get a hold of the dried chiles, or you don’t have the time, canned red chile sauce works fine as a base for this sauce. Red chile enchilada sauce works too, though you may need to add some chili powder to it to increase the heat. In any case you are going to pump up the sauce a bit with ground cloves, cinnamon, and cumin.\n \nThe sauce is slightly acidic. So, as with marinating chicken overnight with yogurt or buttermilk, a long marinating time in this sauce will help the chicken be surprisingly moist and tender.\n','Red Chile Marinated Grilled Chicken Recipe','','','3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts, preferably thighs, trimmed of excess skin and fatSalt1 1/4 cup Mexican red chili sauce, either homemade* or canned (if you are gluten intolerant and are using canned chili sauce, make sure to read the ingredients on the can, some makers put wheat products in their sauce)1 Tbsp olive oil1 Tbsp white or cider vinegar1/2 teaspoon ground cloves1/2 teaspoon ground allspice1 teaspoon cinnamon1/4 teaspoon ground cuminA couple of turns on a black pepper grinderA pinch of dried oregano, crushed1 teaspoon minced garlicAvocado slicesThinly sliced lettuce or cabbageThinly sliced radishesCilantro','1 Heat oil in a medium sized saucepan on medium heat.  Add the chili sauce.  Add vinegar (2 Tbsp if using canned sauce, 4 Tbsp in you\'ve made your own sauce), cloves, allspice, cinnamon, cumin, black pepper, oregano and garlic.  Bring to a simmer and let simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove pan from heat and let cool.\n\n2 Sprinkle salt over all the chicken pieces on all sides.  Put chicken pieces in a non-reactive bowl or a large freezer bag.  Add the marinade, make sure all pieces are coated well with the marinade.  Marinate in the refrigerator at least one hour, preferably overnight.\n\n3 Remove the chicken from the refrigerator before starting up the grill.  Preheat your grill, allowing for a space on the grill for cooking the chicken with indirect heat.  (If using coals, move all the coals to one side of the grill, if using gas, after the grill is hot, turn off one of the burners.) Brush the grill grates with olive oil.  Make sure the chicken pieces are well coated on all sides with the paste-like marinade.  Place the chicken pieces on the indirect heat part of the grill (not over a flame or coals).  Cook, covered, for 25-30 minutes, turning the pieces over after the first 15 minutes.  Try to keep the temperature in the grill around 350°F.  Chicken is done when juices run clear, breasts have an internal temperature of 165°F and thighs 175°F.\n\n3a no grill If you aren\'t in a grilling mood, you can bake the chicken pieces in the oven.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Place the chicken pieces in a roasting pan, skin-side up.  Cook for about 45-50 minutes, until breasts have an internal temperature of 165°F and thighs 175°F.\n\nServe garnished with sliced avocado, sliced lettuce or cabbage dressed with a little vinegar and oil, sliced radishes and cilantro.\n\nMakes for great leftover chicken to cut up and put into tacos.','Serves 4-6. '),('Mexican Red Chili Sauce','Red chili sauces are used in many Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes, such as red chile enchiladas or tamales. On doing research for this post I found references to many different ways of making red chile sauce; in Mexico alone there are as many ways to prepare this sauce as there are varieties of chilies, and even more when you take into account the regional twists. The following is a recipe for a basic red chili sauce, made with Ancho chilies (called by some Pasilla chiles – see notes). The basic technique was taught to me by my Mexican friend, Arturo Vargas, and helped along with notes from Diana Kennedy’s From My Mexican Kitchen: Techniques and Ingredients.\nWhy make your own sauce? Making your own chile sauce is not much different than making your own spaghetti sauce. If you have the time, it’s worth doing. In addition to creating a sauce with fantastic taste, dried chilies are inexpensive and easy to store. If you are making up a large batch of tamales, enchiladas, or chili beans you will likely need a lot of sauce, and if you make your own, you can easily make as much sauce as you need. Do you have a favorite recipe for Mexican or Tex-Mex chili sauce? If so, please let us know in the comments.\n','Mexican Red Chili Sauce Recipe','','','3 dried Ancho (sometimes called pasilla in the US*) chiles  OR 2 Ancho and 2 Guajillo chilesWater1 large clove garlic2 whole cloves, crushed2 black peppercorns, crushed1/2 teaspoon of salt, more to tasteOlive oil','\n\n1 Working on one chile at a time, use a paring knife to cut a slit all the way down one side of a chile.  Open up the chile and remove the stem and seeds.  Remove as much of the veins as you can.  Reserve a few of the seeds or veins for adding later if you want added heat. Note when working with chilies, either wear protective gloves or wash your hands very thoroughly with soap and warm water after handling the chilies.  Do not touch or rub your eyes if you have been handling chili peppers.\n\n2 Heat a large skillet on medium heat.  Flatten out the dried chilies as well as you can and place on the skillet to heat.  Press down on the opened chilies and leave for a few seconds.  Turn the chilies over and heat a few seconds more.  You do not want to toast or burn the chilies, just heat them enough to draw out more of the flavor.\n\n\n\n3 Add the chilies to a small saucepan and add enough water so that they are just covered.  Bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes, until the chilies have softened and plumped up.   (OR pour place the chilies in a small saucepan and pour boiling water over them to cover.  Let sit for 15 minutes, until softened.)\n\n\n\n4 Reserving the soaking water, remove the chilies from the pan and place in a blender.  Add the garlic, salt, ground pepper, ground cloves, and 1 1/2 cups of the soaking liquid (taste the soaking water first, if it seems bitter, use water instead).  Purée for 2 minutes, until the sauce is completely smooth. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning.  If you want more heat, add in a few of the seeds or veins and purée some more.  Add more salt if needed.\n\n\n\n5 Pour the sauce through a sieve into a skillet.  Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the sauce.  Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to maintain the simmer, cook for 10 minutes.  Skim off the foam.  Remove from heat.  Use immediately or pour into a glass jar (plastic will get stained) and refrigerate.\n\nMakes a little more than 1 cup.',''),('Beef Roulades with Walnut Parsley Pesto','Please welcome Hank Shaw as he shares a holiday favorite, flank steak roulades with pesto and bacon. ~Elise\nRoulades, pinwheels, whatever you call them, this is a classic party dish. When I was a boy, my mum used to make these for our Christmas Eve smorgasbord, where they took their place alongside Swedish meatballs and huge plates of cold cuts, cheeses, pickles and such. Some years she’d serve them with Hollandaise sauce, which made them very, very rich even for a little kid.\nMum’s version didn’t use pesto. Her filling was just parsley and garlic salt. But with those two ingredients already in the mix, it’s only a step away from a full-fledged pesto—especially the classic winter pesto of parsley and walnuts.\nThis is not mum’s exact recipe, but it comes close: Super tender meat, smoky, fatty bacon and an intense hit of parsley in the center. Even though I last ate these close to 30 years ago, I can still remember that parsley. It was so “adult” when I was a kid. My addition of the pesto, with the walnuts and cheese, makes my version as rich as mum’s, only without the Hollandaise. I do like a squeeze of lemon on the roulade right at the table.\nMaking these roulades isn’t hard, but it requires a little dexterity to secure the roulade with the kitchen twine. Once the roulade is tied, however, it’s pretty sturdy.\nDon’t skimp on the tenderizing process at the beginning of this recipe. Flank steak can be very chewy, so you will want to pound it well, and a meat mallet’s tenderizing side is a good finishing step. If you don’t have a meat mallet, use the point of a sharp knife to pierce the meat all over.\n','Beef Roulades with Walnut Parsley Pesto Recipe','30 minutes','35 minutes','1 cup chopped parsley1/2 cup shelled walnuts, about 1 3/4 ounces1/4 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped1/4 teaspoon salt1/4 cup olive oil1/2 pound thin-cut bacon1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds flank steakSalt and black pepperLemon wedges to serve','1 Start by making the pesto. Put the parsley, cheese, garlic, salt and walnuts into a food processor. Pulse to combine. Turn the machine on again and slowly pour in the olive oil, just to combine. Reserve.\n2 Cook the bacon in a large pan — you will be searing the roulade in this later, so it needs to be wide — over medium-low heat until it is about half-cooked. You want it cooked, but still limp. Do not crisp it up or it will break when you try to wrap it inside the roulade. When the bacon is ready, set it aside on paper towels.\n3 Place heavy duty plastic wrap (or two layers of plastic wrap) on a large work surface and place the flank steak on it. Cover with more plastic wrap. Using a rubber mallet, the flat side of a meat mallet or an empty wine bottle, pound the flank steak until it is 1/2 inch thick or thinner. Flip the meat from time to time to pound everything evenly. Once the meat is as thin as you want it, if you have a meat mallet with a tenderizing side (the pointy side), remove the plastic wrap and pound this on both sides for a minute or two. If you don\'t have a meat mallet, you can skip this step.\n\n4 Look at your steak: You will be rolling it up with the grain of the meat facing side to side. You do this because when you slice it later, the beef will be more tender when you cut across the grain. Arrange the meat until the grain faces side to side, and if it is not squarish or rectangular, cut it to fit. Sprinkle on some salt and black pepper.\n\n5 Spread a thin layer of pesto on the meat, leaving about 1/2 inch free on all sides of the meat. Lay down the bacon against the grain of the beef. Preheat the oven to 350°F.\n\n6 Carefully roll  the roulade up tightly, as you would a carpet. If you want, cut off any bacon that is extending beyond the steak. Tie off the meat with 6 to 8 lengths of string, each about an inch or so apart. Sear the tied roulade in the pan with the bacon fat. You want to quickly brown the surface, not cook the inside of the roulade.\n\n7 Put the roulade in a roasting pan on a rack, seam side down. If you don\'t have a rack, improvise with celery stalks. Roast this for 20-25 minutes, or until the interior of the meat is 130°F. (Note that the ends of the roulade will be far hotter than the center — so always test the temperature from the center of the roulade.)\n8 Remove the meat from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Slice the roulade so each serving is wrapped in string. You can either let everyone cut their own string at the table, or cut it yourself and secure the roulades with toothpicks if you want. Serve with lemon wedges to add a little tartness to the dish.\n','Serves 4-6.'),('Walnut Parsley Pesto','I usually think of pesto as a summer food, given the way the basil takes over in the garden. Pesto making is just something you do with all that bounty. But you can easily make fresh pesto in the fall or winter using parsley and walnuts instead of basil or pine nuts. It’s just as green, garlicky, cheesy, and nutty. And great on pasta, with beef, or as a sandwich spread. I’ll even put it in cheese tacos. Or just keep dipping my fingers in until it’s all gone.

Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then pulse again. Drizzle in the olive oil while the machine is running just long enough to incorporate the oil, about 20-30 seconds.\nUse immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate to store. Will last several days chilled.\nUse with pasta or as a spread on bread or toast.\n','Makes about 1 1/4 cups.'),('Raspberry Walnut Tart','Oh my. This one is crazy good, and perfect for the holidays. Please make it. You’ll thank me, and your guests will thank you. Picture this—a buttery shortbread crust, lined with chopped walnuts and smothered with raspberries, filled with a simple custard batter and baked. It’s like a clafoutis wrapped in a shortbread cookie. The tart raspberries with the buttery crust? Amazing.\nIt’s easy to make. The crust requires no rolling out. You just process flour, butter, and powdered sugar in a food processor or blender until it comes together in a dough, and then you press the dough into a tart pan with your fingers. You do pre-bake the crust, and I find that freezing a crust before you pre-bake it helps keep the crust sides from collapsing as they bake, so this step may be a little fussy, but it’s not hard.\nWe used a ceramic tart pan for this tart. I’m guessing that it would work just as well with a metal pan with a removable bottom, as long as you placed the pan on top of a rimmed baking sheet in the oven to catch any butter from the crust that may leak.\nMany thanks to my friend Gabrielle who gave us this recipe with a twinkle in her eye, just knowing how much we would enjoy her raspberry walnut tart. Thanks Gabby!\n','Raspberry Walnut Tart Recipe','','','1 1/2 cups (200g) flour1/2 cup powdered sugar (80g)1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup or 12 Tbsp) butter3/4 cup (75g) chopped walnuts10 ounces (283g) frozen or fresh raspberries (do not defrost if frozen)2 eggs3/4 cup (150g) white granulated sugar1/4 (35g) cup flour1/2 teaspoon baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon vanilla','\n1 Make the crust. Place the crust ingredients—flour, powdered sugar, and butter—in a blender or food processor. Process until a dough forms, about 30 seconds to a minute. Lightly grease the inside of  a 9 to 10 inch wide, 1 inch high, tart pan with a little butter.  Place the dough in the tart pan. (You can use a pie dish if you do not have a tart pan.) Use your fingers to spread the dough and press it evenly all over the inside of the tart pan.  (You can use a rolling pin to roll over the top of the tart pan to remove any excess dough and create an even top edge.) Place in the freezer and freeze for one hour or longer.\n\nPre-bake in a 350°F (175°C) oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until nicely browned all over. Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes.\n2 Heat the oven again to 350F (175°C). Place the chopped walnuts in the crust in the tart pan and spread evenly over the bottom. Place the fresh or frozen raspberries on top of the walnuts and spread in an even layer.\n\n3 Beat together the remaining filling ingredients—eggs, sugar, flour, baking powder, salt, vanilla—until smooth. Pour the egg mixture over the raspberries and walnuts in the crust.\n4 Bake in the oven on the middle rack for 40 minutes, or until the top is nicely browned and the filling has set.  When you remove the tart from the oven the center should still wiggle just a little. Take a sharp knife around the edge of the tart to separate it a little bit from the pan. This will make it easier to remove pieces once the tart has cooled.\nLet cool to room temperature to serve.\n','Serves 8.'),('Roasted Butternut Squash, Radicchio, and Onion','Here’s a wintery, festive side dish for your holiday table—cubes of butternut squash, along with wedges of radicchio and onion, tossed with salt and olive oil, and roasted in a hot oven until caramelized, then tossed again with toasted pine nuts, balsamic vinegar, parsley, and shredded Parmesan cheese. Wow. My tummy does a happy dance just thinking about making and eating this again. Radicchio is naturally a little bitter, but it loves being grilled or roasted, and it has a special affinity for balsamic vinegar and Parmesan cheese (see our grilled radicchio salad recipe). Combine those ingredients with the sweetness and substance of butternut squash and onions, and now your palate is firing on all levels – sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. Great alongside roast beef or prime rib, or as a vegetarian meal in and of itself.\n','Roasted Butternut Squash, Radicchio, and Onion Rec','15 minutes','45 minutes','1 medium butternut squash (about 2 pounds), peeled and cut into chunks1 large onion, peeled and cut into wedges through the root1 head radicchio, cut into wedges through the rootOlive oilSalt and black pepper1/2 cup pine nuts1/4 cup chopped parsleyGrated parmesan or pecorino cheese to taste, about 1/4 cup to 1/3 cupBalsamic vinegar to taste, about a tablespoon','1 Preheat the oven to 400°F. Toss the squash chunks, onion and radicchio wedges in olive oil and salt them well. Arrange in one layer on baking sheets (you may need two) and put in the oven.  Roast the vegetables until their edges are nicely caramelized, turning the radicchio and onion wedges over about halfway through the roasting. The radicchio, onion, and squash will roast at different speeds. So periodically you\'ll have to remove the finished vegetables and let the others remain in the oven to finish roasting. As a guideline, roast the radicchio for about 25 minutes, turning halfway. Roast the onions about 35 minutes, again, turning halfway. Roast the squash pieces for 45 minutes, but do not turn. In all cases do not remove from the oven until you see browning on the edges.\n2 While the vegetables are roasting, toast the pine nuts.  Heat a small pan on medium high heat.  Add the pine nuts in a single layer. Cook until lightly toasted. Remove from heat to a bowl to keep the nuts from burning.\n3 Once all the vegetables are cool enough to handle, roughly chop the radicchio and onion into manageable pieces. Place the radicchio, onion, and butternut squash in a large serving bowl. Add the pine nuts and parsley. Add black pepper to taste.  Drizzle with balsamic vinegar. Stir gently to combine, taking care not to squish the soft roasted squash.\nTo serve, sprinkle with some grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese.\n','Serves 6-8 as a side dish.'),('Agua de Jamaica (Hibiscus Tea)','Walk in to practically any taqueria in California and you’ll likely find supersized containers of agua frescas, right next to the soda dispenser. The usual flavors are horchata (a sweet rice drink), tamarindo (from tamarind, and agua de jamaica (pronounced hah-MY-kah), an infusion of dried red hibiscus flowers. I almost always go for the ruby red jamaica, I think just because I love the color. The taste is slightly tart and refreshing. If you’ve ever had red zinger tea from Celestial Seasonings, it’s a little like that. Or a little like cranberry juice. With a squeeze or two of lime juice it becomes almost punch-like.\n \nHibiscus tea (an infusion actually) is popular all around the world. The hibiscus flower grows in tropical and semi-tropical climates. I remember hibiscus trees all over Los Angeles where I grew up. You can find the dried hibiscus flowers at almost any Mexican market (look for “flor de jamaica”), or you can order them online.\nBy the way, the tea is a natural diuretic and has lots of Vitamin C. There’s also at least one government study that shows that hibiscus tea lowers blood pressure.\n','Agua de Jamaica (Hibiscus Tea) Recipe','5 minutes','25 minutes','2 quarts water3/4 to 1 cup sugar (depending on how sweet you would like it to be)1 cup dried hibiscus flowers1/2 cinnamon stick (optional)A few thin slices ginger (optional)Allspice berries (optional)Lime juice (optional)Orange or lime slices for garnish','1 Put 4 cups of the water and the sugar in a medium saucepan.  Add cinnamon, ginger slices, and/or a few allspice berries if you would like. Heat until boiling and the sugar has dissolved.  Remove from heat.  Stir in the dried hibiscus flowers.  \n\n2 Cover and let sit for 20 minutes.  Strain into a pitcher and discard the used hibiscus flowers, ginger, cinnamon, and/or allspice berries.\n\n(At this point you can store ahead the concentrate, chilled, until ready to make the drink.)\n\n3 Add remaining 4 cups of water (or if you want to chill the drink quickly, ice and water) to the concentrate, and chill.  Alternatively you can add ice and chilled soda water for a bubbly version.  Add a little lime juice for a more punch-like flavor.\n\nServe over ice with a slice of orange or lime.

Especially on a scorchingly hot summer day. Agua frescas are refreshing fruit drinks they sell all over Mexico, and that you can find in this country at almost any taqueria. They’re cooling and sweet and are great alongside spicy food. This particular agua fresca is made with cucumbers, fresh limes, and mint. My good friend and local caterer Arturo Vargas made this for us the other day, inspired by agua frescas he enjoyed while trying to keep cool in the steamy Yucatan peninsula. It’s the cucumber juice base that seems to have the effect of lowering one’s body temperature. (Gives new meaning to the phrase “cool as a cucumber”.) In any case, this is a drink that I wouldn’t have made but for my friend who knew I would like it.
